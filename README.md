# nvd-cve-parser by 1vere$k
The POC as the NVD parser for CVEs, CPEs and CWEs with all and known/used exploits.  
The parser will be able to work in offline mode (for the closed networks) and online if you need it.  
So, here is a huge work on go, just wait for a month and don't look into it yet.
## About NVD
The NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, security related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics.

Originally created in 1999 (called Internet - Categorization of Attacks Toolkit or ICAT), the NVD has undergone multiple iterations and improvements and will continue to do so to deliver its services. The NVD is a product of the NIST Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory and is sponsored by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency.

The NVD performs analysis on CVEs that have been published to the CVE Dictionary. NVD staff are tasked with analysis of CVEs by aggregating data points from the description, references supplied and any supplemental data that can be found publicly at the time. This analysis results in association impact metrics (Common Vulnerability Scoring System - CVSS), vulnerability types (Common Weakness Enumeration - CWE), and applicability statements (Common Platform Enumeration - CPE), as well as other pertinent metadata. The NVD does not actively perform vulnerability testing, relying on vendors, third party security researchers and vulnerability coordinators to provide information that is then used to assign these attributes. As additional information becomes available CVSS scores, CWEs, and applicability statements are subject to change. The NVD endeavors to re-analyze CVEs that have been amended as time and resources allow to ensure that the information offered is up to date.
## Plans for the nearest future
So, NVD parser will work in few possible ways as I see it now:
 * Knowledge base for the known/used CVEs, CWEs, CPEs in a comfortable view.  
Now, I see all the views as a comfortable to use spreadsheets as XLXS, Google or maybe the Airtable to have all needed functions for data processing.  
   (It isn't ready yet - in TODOs).
 * Knowledge base for the all CVEs, CWEs and CPEs made by device(s) for the network monitoring.  
Now, I see all the views as a comfortable to use spreadsheets as XLXS, Google or maybe the Airtable to have all needed functions for data processing.  
   (Actually working on it, the data grabber is ready, view is on to go).
 * Libraries analyser as a lintor for the corporate projects with a comfortable security report as a part of your CI/CD process with an optimal runtime.
